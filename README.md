Using Machine Learning Models to classify images:

In this exponentially advancing world, lots of big-data is created every second. And when it comes to big-data, "images" are the best examples. Tons of images are uploaded every second on the internet, and it would be a big boon if those images can be easily dealt with and classified automatically. Image identification and classification is already being implemented at large scales in facebook and other social media.

Here, the goal is to implement ML models namely logistic regression, KNN, SVMs and CNNs to train and identify images, and ultimately come up with a best fitting model. 


Dataset used -- CIFAR-10 (Kaggle)
